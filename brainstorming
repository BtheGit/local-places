App -> Menu -> [Map; Adminpage; (DetailPage -> DetailAdminPage)]
(If I switched to redux, menu and map could be parallel)

Menu
-----

Manage Database (Import data)
Build List
Generate Markers
Select List Entry (Highlight on Map, pop out infowindow, infowindow leads to detail page)  - pass as a callback to map
Hover list entry (CSS only?) - needs to also highlight corresponding map marker if visible (or maybe even if not, performance question)
