    description: `One of Kaohsiung's best places to play boardgames. Tobey's has arguably the largest and most diverse 
                  selection of games in town. The cost is 40NT per person per hour to play in the store. Games are also available
                  to borrow at a cost of 10% of the retail price of the game per day. Borrowing requires you to put down 
                  the full retail cost of the game as deposit as well. \n
                  Tobey's offers one of the largest games venues in town as well, with plenty of space upstairs to play, you'd be
                  hard-pressed to not find a table if you just dropped in with friends (doesn't hurt to call ahead for big groups
                  though). `
